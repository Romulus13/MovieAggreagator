# MovieAggreagator
Project that searches Youtube and Imdb in order to fetch their results for a certain search query.

Things to improve upon:

1. Unit tests (but not testing Youtube and Imdb services)
2. Exception handler that catches all exceptions
3. More detaield logging.
4. Setup api keys to be somehow encrypted.
5. Fuzzy string search 
6. Setting up a mechanism if search from database hasn't given satisfactory results to immediately call APIs.
